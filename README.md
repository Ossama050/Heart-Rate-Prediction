# Heart-Rate-Prediction

## Overview
  - In this project, I have used four different types of classification models to predict tht heart failure rate. The algorithms I have used to predict the heart failure rate are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machines. In the notebook, I have also completed a detailed exploratory data analysis of the dataset and evaluated the effect of each variable with the death rate. I found out that Logistic Regression has the greatest accuracy percentage i.e. 80.00% than the other three classification algorithms.
  
  ### Dataset
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).

### Required Libraries
  You will need the following set of libraries: 
  
  - matplotlib - a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures
  - numpy - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
  - pandas - provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python
  - sklearn - a software machine learning library
  - plotly - a graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs
  - seaborn - a library to develop statistical graphs
